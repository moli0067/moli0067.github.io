<h2>About me</h2>

<p>Hello! My name is Sara Molina, and I really enjoy creating websites and challenging myself every day. I like learning new things and trying to apply them. When I enrolled in the program, I was afraid of taking this class because I thought it would be confusing and very challenging. However, now I find it really cool and not that difficult.</p>

<p>I have always believed that I must be <mark>disciplined</mark> because learning, for me, is the key to success. That is why I always try to improve day by day and practice everything that is explained to me, setting new challenges and expanding my knowledge. I also really like design; I enjoy making everything look aesthetically pleasing, whether it's an assignment or a poster I am working on. My goal is to combine all these skills I have and improve them daily so that through my designs I can create a positive impact.</p>
